      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Privacy Policy – Funn – The Party Challenge Game</h2>

      <p class="meta">This policy describes how the application handles data and device features.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Funn – The Party Challenge Game (hereinafter referred to as “App”) respects the privacy of its users’ data.
        The App only uses device features necessary for its operation and does not collect or share personal data with
        third parties unless explicitly requested by the user.
      </p>

      <h3>Device Features and Data Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access</strong>: The App uses the camera solely for taking pictures or videos within the app’s features. Recordings are stored on the device by default and are not transmitted to external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone Access</strong>: The App uses the microphone for audio recordings or real-time audio processing. Audio data is processed/stored on the device and is not transmitted to external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: The App stores settings, captured media, and necessary files exclusively on the device. The App does not transmit data to third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Paid Content (In-App Purchases)</strong>: The App offers paid content (e.g., features, content modules, or subscriptions). In-app purchases are handled by the store (Google Play). The App does not have access to the user’s payment information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note</em>: The App does not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, location) and does not use analytics or advertising services unless explicitly stated below.</p>

      <h3>Sharing Results</h3>
      <p>
        The App allows users to share competition results in text form through other applications (e.g., messaging, email).
        The App does not automatically transmit data and does not store shared content. Data handling during sharing is
        governed by the chosen external service provider’s policies.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        The App does not integrate external analytics, advertising, or cloud services. In-app purchases are managed by Google
        Play Billing under Google’s Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <h3>User Rights and Data Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Deletion</strong>: Users can delete any files created or stored by the App on their device at any time and can uninstall the App, which removes all local data.</li>
        <li><strong>Permission Management</strong>: Camera and microphone usage requires user-granted system permissions, which can be revoked at any time in the device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        The App does not perform remote data retention. Data stored on the device remains until the user decides to delete it.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        The App has exclusive access to data stored on the device. We recommend users enable available device security
        features (screen lock, encryption) and keep the App updated to the latest version.
      </p>

      <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        The App is not specifically designed for children. If a child uses the App, parental supervision is advised.
        The App does not collect personal data from children.
      </p>
